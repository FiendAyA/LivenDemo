# LivenDemo

A demo for liven task.

From my perspective, this app was basically designed for those carpenters or restaurant workers who could quickly calculate and show the receipts for customers.

Used some features in https://github.com/KunMinX/UnPeek-LiveData, https://github.com/CymChad/BaseRecyclerViewAdapterHelper and https://github.com/hegaojian/JetpackMvvm to build up basic Android coding structure.

This is a manually ordered system followed by several steps:
1. Select food in Home page and customer who orders the food(optional)
2. Select payway, paytype and discount to generate invoice in invoice page.
3. After reviewing invoice, you could pay for the bill and submit the transaction.
4. Check all transactions in transaction page.
5. It will auotmatically upload all transactions to firebase.
