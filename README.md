# LivenDemo

A demo for liven task.

From my perspective, this app was basically designed for those carpenters or restaurant workers who could quickly calculate and show the receipts for customers.

Used some features in https://github.com/KunMinX/UnPeek-LiveData and https://github.com/hegaojian/JetpackMvvm to build up basic Android coding structure.
